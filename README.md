Hello there, and welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I’m a Senior Health AI Scientist working at the intersection of generative AI, agentic systems, and multimodal biomedical data. I build reliable, interpretable, and production-grade AI systems for real-world healthcare impact. I currently work with the Enterprise AI organization at [Humana](https://www.humana.com), where I develop responsible generative AI and agentic architectures for large-scale healthcare workflows. Previously, I served as a Machine Learning Scientist in the the Office of the Chief Data Officer ([OCDO](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org)) at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), where I led the development and deployment of institution-wide clinical NLP and machine learning systems for automated, longitudinal phenotyping and cohort identification from large-scale EHR data. Before industry, I completed my Ph.D. and postdoctoral training in [Biomedical Informatics and Computational Genomics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) at the University of Pennsylvania [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu). In addition to my doctoral degree, I hold a M.A. in Statistics and Data Science from the [Wharton School of Business](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu), as well as undergraduate degrees in Statistics and Computer Science from [Duke University](https://duke.edu). In addition to my industry work, I serve as a guest lecturer in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu), and I previously collaborated with the [Health Futures Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) on applied research at the intersection of biomedical discovery and emerging AI technologie 

My areas of focus include:
-   Responsible generative AI and agentic systems in healthcare

-   Multimodal and transformer-based machine learning

-   Clinical NLP and real-world healthcare data

-   Translational informatics and personalized medicine

-   Evaluation, governance, and human-centered AI system design

I am always open to speaking, teaching, collaboration, consulting, and outreach opportunities.
