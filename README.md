Hello there, and welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I am a biomedical data scientist and health machine learning researcher based in Seattle, WA. I currently work for the Office of the Chief Data Officer ([OCDO](https://hutchdatascience.org)) at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html). My role centers on the development and productization of statistical models and machine learning systems for electronic phenotyping and cohort identification across the institution. I also serve as a guest lecturer in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) and a collaborator with the [Health Futures Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/). Prior to my position at Fred Hutch, I completed my Ph.D. and postdoctoral training in [Biomedical Informatics and Computational Genomics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) at the University of Pennsylvania [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu). In addition to my doctoral degree, I hold a M.A. in Statistics and Data Science from the [Wharton School of Business](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu), as well as a B.Sc. with honors in Statistics, a B.Sc. in Computer Science, and a minor in Computational Biology from [Duke University](https://duke.edu).

My general research skills and interests include:

-   translational bioinformatics and personalized medicine

-   big data analysis

-   deep learning and generative AI

-   data visualization

-   network science

-   human-centered design

I am always open to speaking, teaching, collaboration, consulting, and outreach opportunities.
